# River Intervention Explorer

## What this is
This repository tracks a progressive web app (PWA) that is developed to communicate my PhD research. For more information about my research see [University profile](https://people.utwente.nl/k.d.berends), the [RiverCare knowledge base](https://kbase.ncr-web.org/rivercare)


It is made with Leaflet & friends (plugins), OpenStreetMap, CartoDB and magic. 

Visit https://kdberends/github.io/mbd for the live version of the website. 

Development is done in the development branch. The master branch holds the live version.
