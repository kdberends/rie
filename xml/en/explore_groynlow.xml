Groynes, or spur dams, are barriers that (1) are positioned perpendicular to the dominant flow directon and (2) do not cover the full width of the flow. Their main purpose is to increase the flow velocity in the center of the river, which in turn leads to greater depths due to erosion of sediment.

However, during flood events groynes hinder flow. Lowering them may alleviate that problem. However, result show that this is not very effective. This is not surprising: the groynes were already lowered in previous years. Further lowering them is not expected to yield more than a few centimeters decrease in flood levels.
