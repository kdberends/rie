Perhaps the most intuitive way to lower water levels is to lower the bed itself. By excavating the floodplains, more water can fit in the river at the same water levels
<br/>
<br/>
The solution we have implemented here is rather artificial: to study the effect (and uncertainty!) of floodplain lowering in isolation, we have only lowered the floodplain - along with every every tree, plant and building. In reality, this would be quite the trick. More realistically, the lowered floodplain would have entirely new flora, which is expected to dramatically increase the uncertainty of the predicted effect (see <em>floodplain smoothing</em>).
