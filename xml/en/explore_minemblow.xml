Floodplains are littered with small barriers that obstruct flow such as hedges and fences. These features contribute to flow resistance. Lowering them may alleviate this problem.

On the map, all embankments that were lowered are shown. The results are not spectacular: only a few centimeters in water level decrease with a relatively large uncertainty to boot.
