In this part of the river, the dikes or levees are the primary defence against flooding. Although very effective, dikes also cause bottlenecks. For example, at <a href="#" onclick="mapZoomToStAndries()">km 925</a>, the floodplains narrow as flow is forces through the meander. 
<br/>
<br/>
To alleviate this situation, we have relocated the dikes. Our study shows that this intervention is very effective in lowering water levels, with little uncertainty.

<br/>
However, this is a very invasive solution, as it envelopes five villages. Therefore, this is not a viable solution without extreme societal support.
