The floodplains are populated with all kinds of vegetation, which is beneficial for a variety of functions. However, during high flow trees, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69iB-xy0u4A"> shrubberies </a> and hedges can offer a lot of resistance to flow.
<br/>
<br/>
For this intervention, all vegetation in the green zone is replaced with grass. Grass offers little resistance against flow. This has the potential to lower water levels significantly.

<br/>
However, it also introduces a lot of uncertainty because it changes a lot about the river, while the effect is <em>relatively</em> low. You will see that other intervention change less of the existing river, but are relatively more effective. Therefore, these alternative interventions are less uncertain.
