Ever wondered how rivers are kept under control?
<br/>
<br/>
Rivers are a force of nature, and vital to human society. Just like roads, buildings and your teeth, rivers need to be regularly checked for health and safety. And if so necessary, fixed. 

But how do we 'fix' our rivers?... Let's take a look at one important aspect: preventing river flooding.
</div>

<div id="1">
First let's take a (simplified) look at the river above to understand how stuff works. 
<br/>
<br/>
When it comes down to it, the water level in the river depends on three things: the amount of water, the shape of the river and the resistance against flow. 
</div>

<div id="2">
For example, if less water enters the river, the water level goes down...
</div>

<div id="3">
And if resistance to flow increases, the water level goes up. 
<br/>
<br/>
(Flow resistance can be difficult to understand, ...)
</div>

<div id="4">
So if we exactly measure the flow, geometry and resistance, we can calculate how high the water level is! Even better: we can also calculate how we can lower water levels by changing one of those things.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, we can <a onclick="CompareFigure.changeInterventionDepth(-1)">locally lower the river bed</a>. 
<br/>
<br/>
In this way, we use models to predict the effect of river engineering. There is only one problem...
</div>

<div id="5">
...we can't measure everything. At least, not precisely. But what we can do is to make a good guess. This is a bit like predicting whether it is going to rain next week: it may be 'likely', but it is not 100% certain. 
<br/>
<br/>
The calculation of these chances involves many complicated computations. In science, this is called 'uncertainty quantification'. 
</div>

<div id="6">
So predictions of the effect of river engineering are uncertain... But how much? 
<br/>
<br/>
This was the central question of our study. We designed various interventions aimed at lowering flood water levels on a real life study case:
</div>

<div id="7">
This is the River Waal, the most important river in The Netherlands. It connects the Port of Rotterdam to Germany and is the largest distributary of the River Rhine. 
<br/>

</div>
<div id="8">
We used a sophisticated computer model to calculate flow velocities and water levels during high flow: approximately 10 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic-size_swimming_pool">olympic swimming pools</a> per second!
<br/>
<br/>
</div>
<div id="9">
For any point along the river, we have calculated the uncertainty of model output. The figure above shows the histogram of water levels near the City of Tiel, which shows the range of possible water levels. 
<br/>
<br/>
Downstream from this point is a known bottleneck. We designed twelve different interventions to lower water levels.
</div>
<div id="10">
Let's take a look at one possible solution: removing all trees and plants so that we only have grass. We see that on average the water level will decrease with a maximum of 30 cm. However, there is a lot of uncertainty. In fact, it is likely that the water level will only be decrease by xx cm!
</div>
<div id="11">
Alternatively, we can dig side channels. This option is much less uncertain, and has a higher effect. A simple rule of thumb: the more you change a river, the larger the uncertainty of the effect. 
<br/>
<br/>
This may influence the choice for one of the options. For example, compare this to choosing to bring an umbrella. Would you bring one if the chance for rain is 50%? What about 30%...?
<br/>
<br/>
This is a difficult question. In our paper, we give several suggestion on how to deal with uncertainty, once it is quantified.
